A minimal Swift wrapper for SQLite.

Still under active development - not yet ready for production use.

SQLight is not intended to hide the underlying SQLite API, just make it easier to
use from Swift.

Some extra features are:

* creating scalar and aggregate SQL functions in Swift

Todo:

* SQL parser to allow Swift macros that generate model classes for prepared statements
* The ability to create virtual tables in Swift
